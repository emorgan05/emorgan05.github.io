Back in June, I felt like I needed a clear and concrete goal. As a professor, my semester ended in the middle of May, I taught a couple of summer classes, but online. For me, it meant that I was choosing and setting my own schedule. I needed a little bit of accountability to keep learning and get a couple of projects done. So I signed up for 100Daysof Code and committed to code for 1 hour every day for the next 100 days. 

One of the biggest lessons was that with the push to code for 1 hour every day, I often did more. Once I got started and into the middle of a project, I wanted to see if I could finish it, even after the timer went off. 

My 100 days ended on Saturday, September 23. 
Projects I finished:
www.kimmorgancummings.com -- I had already done the design. I got it live at the start of my 100 days. 
www.emorganportfolio.com -- updates

Created a localhost to maintain an 8 year old site

I learned so much more than these projects represent. I reinforced things I had previously learned and added a bunch of new knowledge.
